      <p class="paragraph">
        This traditional Japanese motif tells a story of harmony between humankind and nature. Flowing lines echo the rhythm of ocean waves, while stylized mountains rise as symbols of timeless wisdom. Cherry blossoms, bamboo, and cloud forms reflect Japan’s deep reverence for the changing seasons and the sacred balance of the natural world.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Widely used during the Edo period (1603–1868) in textiles, ceramics, and woodblock prints, this pattern captures a minimalist beauty rooted in stillness, clarity, and contemplation. Each curve speaks of wind-blown paths, each form a quiet memory of distant landscapes.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        By carrying this design, you carry a piece of cultural heritage – a gentle reminder to travel lightly, respectfully, and in harmony with the world around you.

        <strong>DOVA</strong> is a minimalist, foldable hanger designed for conscious living — offering elegant utility, space efficiency, and sustainable packaging in one beautifully crafted piece.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Made from 100% biodegradable materials, DOVA redefines everyday essentials through thoughtful design. Compact enough to fit in your palm when folded, it expands into a full-sized hanger, ready to serve at home or on the go.

        When its life cycle ends, DOVA can be gently returned to the earth. Simply compost it in a home or industrial composting environment — where it naturally breaks down, leaving no harmful trace behind.
